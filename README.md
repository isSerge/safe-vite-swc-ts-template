# Safe App Vite SWC TypeScript Template

## Overview

This template is designed to offer a streamlined and modern approach to Safe App
development. It's an alternative to the original Safe App template which relies
on `create-react-app`, a tool that is not actively maintained as of late.

## Key Features

- **TypeScript and React**: Harness the power of TypeScript and React for robust
  app development.
- **Vite and SWC**: Benefit from fast builds and compilation with Vite and SWC.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Style your app efficiently with Tailwind CSS.
- **Safe integration**: Includes `@safe-global/safe-apps-react-sdk` and
  `@safe-global/safe-apps-sdk` for seamless integration with the Safe ecosystem.
